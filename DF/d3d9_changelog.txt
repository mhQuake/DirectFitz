- Implemented optimizations and sanity-checking in Mod_LoadLighting (#ifdef MOD_LOAD_LIGHTING_IS_INSANE).
- Added #ifdef RGB_2X_IS_NOT_ENOUGH stuff - With 2x RGB scale some lighting situations still clamp to 255 (yes, even in ID1) so we need to expand to 4x;
  Surfs only because MDLs are good enough.  Take note of https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man2/xhtml/glTexEnv.xml
  "GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if the params value for GL_RGB_SCALE or GL_ALPHA_SCALE are not one of 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0."
- Added mipmapping for MDLs and SPRs because they really look bad (#ifdef NO_MIPMAPPING_LOOKS_BAD).

2017-01-20
- Added quakedef.c and precompiled header on .c files; some structural changes to support PCH generation.

2017-01-18
- Updated waterwarp code for latest vkQuake changes.
- Tweaked waterwarp code for consistency with mankrip's tests.
- Added cvars for CYCLE and AMP.

2017-01-17
- Added #ifdef TXGAMMA stuff.

2017-01-16
- Added HOST_TIMER_FIX stuff to engine because FitzQuake's timer problems were really starting to annoy me.
- Added guards to GL_BeginRendering against GetClientRect failing or trying to use a 0-width/0-height mode.
- Fixed color 255 is not fullbright (#ifdef COLOR_255_IS_NOT_FULLBRIGHT).
- Fixed sky polygons are failing to batch (#ifdef FITZQUAKE_SKY_GIVES_ME_FITS).
- Implemented enough of alphamask textures to test functionality (#ifdef ALPHAMASK_TEXTURES).
- Fixed alpha mask textures with correct default states for GL combine modes.

2017-01-14
- Made GL_NEAREST texture modes take priority over anisotropic filtering.
- Possible performance improvement in mipmap generation.
- Mipmap generation optimization in TexMgr_LoadImage32.
- Overrides for ChoosePixelFormat and DescribePixelFormat.
- Fixed off-by-1 crap in gamma/contrast pass.

2017-01-13
- Added new code to GL_BeginRendering to deal with viewport/rendertarget size mismatch.
- Fixed GL combine and add not being reported on PS 2.0 hardware.

2017-01-12
- Fixed glClear behaviour to more correctly emulate OpenGL behaviour.
- Fixed Alt-tab loses warp images and occasional device reset fail.

2017-01-10
- Added #ifdef FIX_CONSPEED stuff.
- Validate window dimensions for windowed modes to prevent setting modes >= the desktop work area (currently #if'ed out).

2017-01-01
- Completed addition of Quake III shadow volume code.

2016-12-28
- Fixed vsync not being "sticky" across mode changes
- Changed interface to all GL functions to same as is used by Baker; added "API glue" layer.
- Added more robust extensions enumeration.
- Fixed up annoying GL crap in glTexImage.
- Fixed up WGL interface for consistency with main GL interface.
